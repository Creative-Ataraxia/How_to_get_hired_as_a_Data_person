# How to get **hired** as a Data person

## Resume/CV writing chapter

### One:

- Never list {keywords} without showing how it actually helped solve business problems.
  - The first priority of recruiters is not finding an awesome person, but finding the applicant most suitable for the job being applied to.
  - If applicants simply list {action} + {keywords} + {dubious/unverifiable numbers}, this sends recruiters a simple message: "this applicant hasn't really done the actual job, is making things up, or does not understand the business behind the job at all."
  - E.g., "built dashboard... increased client retention by x%" is nonsense; there is no direct logical link.
  - If the logic is: improved dashboard/metrics -> highlighted current problems -> led to the marketing team changing strategies -> led to improved metrics, then this would make sense.
    - Note that the final metrics improvements were directly due to how the marketing/sales team changed their strategies, not directly due to your work (dashboard improvements).
  - What recruiters are looking for here is whether you understood how your actions and contributions correlate to solving actual business problems and driving profits.
    - E.g., Why was this metric chosen? Why/how does it work? What signals is it showing, and what can be done for it?
    - Note: if you're a new grad or entry-level, it's okay for your business conclusions to be wrong, but you have to show your thought process and demonstrate you can think critically.

- Solutions:
  - {keywords} must be followed up with all intermediate steps before leading to business results.

### Two:

- Don't bother listing basic skills; demonstrate them instead.
  - In the tech world, the bar keeps raising. You wouldn't list on your resume that you know how to use Word or Excel, right?
  - With modern gen-AI tools, for any capable technical-minded professional, the initial learning curve for everything is nearly zero.
  - For most daily tasks, writing Python is like using English, and writing SQL is like using Excel. Do not explicitly list these but imply them in your experiences; this will distinguish your CV from more junior ones.

- Solutions:
  - Do not explicitly list `python, sql, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, vscode, data cleaning, common APIs`, etc.

### Three:

- Data analysts are not purely tech positions; 'Domain expertise' is just as important as your ability to use tech/tools.
  - This means during interviews, you will be evaluated on how you assess actual business problems, whether you can identify them, use tools to research them, narrow down the problems, highlight critical issues, discover insights on profit drivers, and recommend solutions to other cross-functional teams.
  - This is why in data-related JDs, requirements such as "Problem solving," "Pattern finding," and "Critical thinking" come up a lot.

- Solution:
  - You must demonstrate in your "work experience" section that you can understand the actual business problems in-depth, abstract core issues, and use mathematical thinking to find solutions.
  - Per this logic, online data competitions (Kaggle) typically should not be the main highlight of your resume.

### Four:

- Prepare different versions of your CV when applying to different position categories; do not use the "spray and pray" job search strategy.
  - Broadly speaking, data-related positions exist on a spectrum that can be roughly divided into 3 segments: Engineers -> Data -> Analysts. The further left you go, the more technical skills you need to showcase; the further right, the more business sense you need to showcase.
  - So understand what will be expected of you when offered the job, and what types of business value you'll be expected to generate via your work.
    - E.g., MLEs will work more on fundamental technicals plus research. Data Analysts will be expected to leverage data as a tool to identify and support solving practical business problems. Data Scientists/Engineers bridge the middle with modeling, pipelines, deployments, and more specific job titles.
  - Different positions' seniority levels also tend to focus on different areas:
    - Juniors will be expected to work on individual market verticals, handle data stores, metrics, pipeline tasks, and dashboards.
    - Seniors will need to interpret Ops/Mkt/Sales teams' needs and translate them into data pipelines (e.g., ad cause/effect analysis, ROI of different channels, marginal cost/benefit analysis), understanding more data dimensions.
    - Managers need to be able to abstract business models into math models, work out fundamental improvements based on math logic, model budget allocations, growth targets, maximize efficiency ratios, monitor verticals and channels, evaluate competitors, market space, and the health of current strategy combinations.
    - Directors will oversee multiple businesses, must allocate resources correctly, and possess in-depth industry domain expertise to set strategies.

- Solution:
  - Find over 50 JDs of the role and industry you are targeting, abstract and summarize which aspects you should emphasize in your CV.

### Five:

- In today's competitive job markets, everyone needs to be accountable for how their job contributes to the final revenue/profits.
  - The data team also has to show stakeholders: "Why these data points?" "Why use data this way?" "How does this data work relate to the bottom line?"
  - This means if you say on your resume that you can "do the right feature engineering and tune the model correctly," it doesn't really help you get a job.
  - What recruiters look for is an applicant that is a "perfect match":
    - Uses the same tech stack
    - Solves the same problems
    - Uses the same logic to come up with the same solutions
    - Reaches the same conclusions
    - Uses the same culture/language to communicate conclusions

- Solutions:
  - Word your resume to reflect 'the same identity.' This is essentially what it means to be 'fit for company culture.'
  - If your work experience is not close enough, plan and do projects that can demonstrate this 'identity.' Kaggle competitions are fun but rarely helpful for recruiters looking for practical real-world experiences.

### Six:

- You need to be able to answer correctly, at least to some degree, what the actual day-to-day work activities are like for the job you're applying to.
  - For example:
    - Get updates from product documents; understand updated data needs
    - Extract previous cycle data; identify issues; deduce solutions
    - Implement solutions on dashboards
    - Communications, writeups, emails, reports

- Solutions:
  - Demonstrate that you understand the key issues, efficiently manage your workflow, implement solutions, and communicate appropriate information scopes to different stakeholders.

### Seven:

- Always remember that technologies are used as tools to solve actual, real-world business problems â€” not to show off flashy techniques or for using's sake alone.
  - Data positions need to work with other teams (product, operations, marketing, etc.) to implement strategies, optimize operations, and drive growth that results in increased ROI for shareholders.
  - If you don't show the real logic of how your work impacted this value chain â€” e.g., if you just say "deployed X, increased revenue by X%" â€” recruiters will likely dismiss this and assume you made it up.

- Solutions:
  - Because deploying an ML model doesn't directly "increase revenue," you need to explain how your model improved specific metrics, enabled insight discovery, led to solutions being found, resulted in actions being implemented, and finally led to increased revenues.
  - The point of all this is to show that you understand why your code is helping to solve real business problems.
  - The "work experiences" listed on your resume need to prove these points.

### Eight:

- Avoid the following 3 types of resume writing mistakes:
  1. {tech_keywords} + {unverifiable_numbers}, which strongly suggests you made the numbers up.
  2. Connecting tech used with business logic, but the scope is way larger than what the applied position covers (e.g., showing director-level responsibilities while applying for a junior position).
  3. Wording that is too honest or humble, e.g., listing all minor and significant tasks done in internships. The correct approach is to show your thoughts on the impacts and how you fit into the bigger picture.

- Solutions:
  - Be clear on your personal brand.
  - Be clear on the type of role you're seeking.
  - Be clear on how your past work experience and projects relate to actual business problems.
