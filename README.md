# How to get **hired** as a Data person

## Resume/CV writing chapter

### One:

	- Never list {keywords} without showing how it actually helped solve business problems
		- 1st priority of recruiters is not finding an awesome person, but to find the applicant that is most suitable for the job being applied to.
		- If applicant simply list {action} + {keywords} + {dubious/unverifiable numbers}, this sends recruiter a simple message: "this applicant hasn't really done the actual job, is making things up or does not understand the business behind the job at all".
		- e.g., "built dashboard.. increased client retention by x%" is nonsense, there is not direct logical link.
		- if the logic is: improved dashboard/metrics -> highlighted current problems -> led to marketing team changing stratgies -> led to improved metrics, then this would make sense.
			- note that final metrics improvements was directly due to how the marketing/sales team changed their strategies, not directly due to your work (dashboard improvements).
		- What recruiters are looking for here is whether you understood how your actions and your contributions correlates to solving actual business problems, and drive profits.
			- e.g., Why was this metric chosen? why/how does it work? what signals is it showing, and what can be done for it?
			- note: if you're a new grad or entry level, it's ok for your business conclusions to be wrong, but you have to show your thought process and demonstrate you can critically think.

	- Solutions:
		- {keywords} must be followed up with all intermediate steps before leading to business results.


### Two:

	- Don't bother listing basic skills, demonstrate them instead.
		- in the tech world, the bar keeps raising, you wouldn't list on your resume that you know how to use word, excel right?
		- with modern gen-AI tools, for any capable technical-minded professionals, the initial learning curve of everything is nearly 0.
		- For the majority of daily tasks, writing Python is like using English, and writing SQL is like using excel. Do not explicitly list these but imply them in your experiences, this should distinguish your CV with the more junior ones.
		
	- Solutions:
		- Do not explicitly list `python, sql, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, vscode, data cleaning, common apis` etc.


### Three:
	
	- Data analysts are not a pure tech position, 'Domain expertise' is just as important as your ability to use tech/tools. 
		- This means during interviews, you will be evaluated on how you assess actual business problems, whether you can identify them, use tools to research them, narrow down the problems, highlight critical issues, discover insights on profit drivers and recommend solutions to other cross-functional teams.
		- This is why in Data related JDs, requirements such as "Problem solving", "Pattern finding", "Critical thinking" etc comes up a lot.
	
	- Solution:
		- You must demonstrate in your "work experience" section that, you are capable to understand the actual business problems in-depth, are able to abstract core issues, and use mathematical thinking to find solutions.
		- Per this logic, online data competitions (Kaggle) typically should not be the main highlight of your resume.


### Four:

	- Prepare different versions of your CV when applying to different position categories, do not use the "spray and pray" job search strategy.
		- Broadly speaking, data-related positions is on a spectrum that can be roughly divided into 3 segments: Engineers -> Data -> Analysts, where the more on the left side of the spectrum you're targeting, the more technical skills you need to showcase, whereas the more on the right, the more business sense you need to showcase.
		- So understand what will be expected of you when you offered the job in this industry, as in, what types of business values you'll expected to generate via your work.
			- e.g., MLEs will work more on fundamental technicals, plus research. Data Analysts will be expected to leverage data as a tool to identify & support solving practical business problems, and Data Scientists/Engineers will be bridge the middle, modeling, pipelines, deployments etc. with more specific job titles.
		- Also, different positions' seniority levels also tend to focus on different areas:
			- Juniors will be expected to work on individual markets verticals, handle data stores, metrics, pipeline tasks and dashboards.
			- Seniors will need more time to interpret Ops/Mkt/Sales teams' needs, and translate them to data pipelines (e.g. om ads cause/effect, ROI of different channels, marginal cost/benefit analysis), understanding more dimensions of the data.
			- Managers needs to be able abstract biz models to math models, work out fundamental improvements based on math logics that can translate into core kpi improvement actions. Also needs to model budget allocations, growth targets, maximize efficiency ratio, monitor verticals, channels, evaluate competitions, mkt space, and the health of current strategy combos.
			- Directors will oversee multiple businesses, must allocate resources correctly, and possess in-depth industry domain expertise to be able to direct and set strategies.
	
	- Solution:
		- find >50 JDs of the role&industry you are targeting, abstract and summary which aspects you should be emphasizing in your CV.


### Five:	

	- In today's competitive job markets, everyone needs to be accountable for how his/her job is contributing to the final revenue/profits.
		- So the data team will also have to show stakeholders, "why are these data particularly?" "why using data this way?", "how are the data works relates to the bottom line"
		- This means if you say on your resume that you are able to "do the right feature engineering, tune the model correctly" doesn't really help you get a job.
		- Basically, what recruiters looks for is the applicant that is a "perfect match":
			- Use the same techs
			- Solve the same problems
			- Use the same logic to come up with the same solutions
			- Reach the same conclusions
			- Using the same culture/language to communicate the conclusions.

	- Solutions:
		- word your resume to reflect 'the same identity', this is essentially what it means to be 'fit for company culture'
		- if your work experience is not close enough, plan and do projects that can demonstrate this 'identity'. Kaggle competitions are fun but, rarely helpful for recruiters that are looking for practical real-world experiences.


### Six:	

	- You need to be able to answer correctly at least to some degree, what the actual day-to-day work activities are like for the job you're applying to.
		- for example: 
			- get updates from product documents, understand updated data needs
			- extract previous cycle data, identify issues, deduce solutions
			- implement solutions on dashboard
			- communications, writeups, emails, reports

	- Solutions:	
		- you will need to demonstrate you understand the key issues, efficiently manage your workflow, implement solutions, and communicate appropriate information scopes to different stakeholders.


### Seven:

	- Always remember technologies are used as tools to solve actual, real-world business problems, not using it to show off flashy techniques, or for using's sake alone.
		- Data positions needs to work with other teams (products, operations, marketing etc.) to implement strategies, optimize operations, and drive growth that results in increased ROI for the shareholders.
		- However, if you don't show the real logic of how your work impacted this value chain, e.g., if you just say "deployed X, increased rev by X%", recruiter will likely dismiss this and chalk it to "you made it up", and you haven't actually done the job.

	- Solutions:
		- Because deploying a ML model doesn't directly "increase revenue", you need to explain how your model improved what metrics, enabled what insight discoveries, led to what solutions being found, resulted in what actions being implemented, and finally led to increased revenues.
		- The point of all these is to show that you are capable of understanding why your codes are helping to solve real business problems.
		- And the "work experiences" listed on your resume needs to prove the above points.

### Eight:

	- Avoid the following 3 types of resume writing:
		1. {tech_keywords} + {unverifiable_numbers}, this strongly suggest you made the numbers up
		2. does connect tech used with business logic, but the scope is way larger than what the position is being applied to. e.g., showing director-level responsibilities but applying for a junior position.
		3. wording are way too honest or humble, e.g., list all the minor and significant tasks done in internships. The correct way is to show your thoughts on the impacts and how you fit into the bigger picture.

	- Solutions:
		- Be clear on your personal brand
		- Be clear on the type of role you're seeking
		- Be clear on how your past work experience and projects relates to actual business problems
